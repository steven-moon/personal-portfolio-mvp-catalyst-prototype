## üìö Documentation

This project includes comprehensive documentation to help you get started and understand the codebase:

- [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) - Quick start guide for developers
- [Technical Documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md) - Detailed technical documentation
- [Networking Guide](./NETWORKING-GUIDE.md) - Guide for using and extending the API architecture
- [Development Log](./documents/FRONTEND-DEV-LOG.md) - Ongoing development log

## üìù Development Logging

**IMPORTANT**: All developers must maintain the development log in [FRONTEND-DEV-LOG.md](./documents/FRONTEND-DEV-LOG.md). This log serves as a critical record of:

- Key implementation decisions
- Major changes to architecture or design
- Bug fixes and their root causes
- Feature additions or modifications
- Problems encountered and their solutions
- Performance improvements

Update the log with dated entries as you make changes. This practice helps with knowledge sharing, onboarding new developers, and troubleshooting.

to provide:
- CardHeader
- CardContent
- CardFooter subcomponents

Addresses #45
```

```
fix(pages): Resolve project gallery layout on mobile devices

Fixed the grid layout issues on the Projects page that caused overflow 
on mobile screens under 375px width. Updated responsive breakpoints and
adjusted card sizing.
```

```
refactor(hooks): Convert useProjects to use React Query

Migrated the custom useProjects hook from manual fetch implementation
to React Query for better caching, refetching, and error handling.
Added loading states and error feedback.
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

For installation instructions and development workflow, see the [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md).

## üîß Configuration

- Update the personal information in `src/data/` directory
- Replace placeholder images with your own in `public/`
- Customize colors and styling in `tailwind.config.ts`

### Environment Variables

The application supports the following environment variables:

- `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA`: Set to `true` to use mock API data instead of real API endpoints (defaults to `true`)

To set up environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory (you can copy from `.env.example`)
2. Set the variables according to your needs

For detailed customization options, refer to the [Technical Documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md#customization-guide).

## üì¶ Deployment
