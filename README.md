## ü§ñ Cursor Rules for AI

This project uses Cursor's Rules for AI feature to maintain consistent coding standards, architecture, and development practices. Rules are located in the `.cursor/rules` directory and help guide AI assistants to follow project-specific conventions.

### How Cursor Rules Work

Rules for AI are markdown files (`.mdc`) that contain guidelines, patterns, and instructions for AI to follow when generating or modifying code. These rules help ensure:

- Consistent code style and formatting
- Adherence to project architecture
- Following best practices for specific technologies
- Implementing proper design patterns

Rules can be applied to specific file patterns using glob patterns and can be set to always apply or only when relevant.

### Example Rules in This Project

1. **General Rules** - Overall coding standards for the project:
   ```
   # Description: General coding guidelines for the Personal Portfolio MVP
   # Globs: *.*

   ## General Project Guidelines
   - This is a React 18+ TypeScript project built with Vite, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components
   - Follow modern React practices using functional components and hooks
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   ...
   ```

2. **Tailwind Rules** - Styling guidelines for consistency:
   ```
   # Description: Tailwind CSS and styling guidelines for the Personal Portfolio MVP
   # Globs: **/*.tsx, **/*.css

   ## Tailwind Usage
   - Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
   - Follow the mobile-first responsive design approach
   - Use Tailwind's color system consistently
   ...
   ```

3. **Component Rules** - React component architecture and patterns:
   ```
   # Description: Guidelines for React components in the Personal Portfolio MVP
   # Globs: src/components/**/*.tsx, src/pages/**/*.tsx

   ## Component Structure
   - Follow a consistent folder structure for components
   - Group related components in the same directory
   - Keep component files small and focused
   ...
   ```

### Creating Your Own Rules

To create or modify rules manually:

1. Create a `.mdc` file in the `.cursor/rules` directory using this command

```
echo "# Description: Guidelines for maintaining Cursor rules" > .cursor/rules/rule_maintenance.mdc && echo "# Globs: .cursor/rules/**/*.mdc" >> .cursor/rules/rule_maintenance.mdc && echo "" >> .cursor/rules/rule_maintenance.mdc && echo "## Rule Maintenance Guidelines" >> .cursor/rules/rule_maintenance.mdc && echo "- Keep Cursor rules up to date with project changes" >> .cursor/rules/rule_maintenance.mdc && echo "- Review and update rules periodically" >> .cursor/rules/rule_maintenance.mdc && echo "- Update rules when adding new technologies or patterns" >> .cursor/
```

2. Write guidelines as markdown sections and bullet points
3. Restart Cursor or reload the rules
