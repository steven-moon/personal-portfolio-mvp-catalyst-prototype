# Globs: **/*.tsx, **/*.css

## Tailwind Usage
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Follow the mobile-first responsive design approach
- Use Tailwind's color system consistently
- Leverage Tailwind's built-in dark mode support
- Use @apply in CSS files only when necessary for repeated patterns

## Custom Styling
- Define custom colors and styles in tailwind.config.ts
- Use consistent spacing with Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use meaningful class names for custom components
- Use tailwind-merge for conditional class application
- Follow class ordering: layout → typography → visual styles → interactivity → misc

## Neumorphic Design with Tailwind
- Use custom shadow utilities defined in tailwind.config.ts
- Maintain a consistent color palette for neumorphic effects
- Use border-radius consistently for the soft UI look
- Implement subtle transitions for interactive elements
- Use the correct background colors to achieve the neumorphic effect

## Responsive Design
- Test all components at multiple breakpoints
- Use sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, and 2xl: breakpoints appropriately
- Avoid fixed widths and heights that could break responsive layouts
- Consider touch targets on mobile devices
- Ensure text remains readable at all screen sizes

## Accessibility
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios
- Use proper semantic HTML elements
- Ensure interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus states
- Add proper ARIA attributes when necessary
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
