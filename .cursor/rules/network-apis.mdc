# Description: Guidelines for network API implementation and usage
# Globs: src/**/*api*.ts,src/**/*Api*.ts,src/**/*service*.ts,src/**/*Service*.ts

## Network API Guidelines
- Use consistent error handling patterns across all API calls using the fetchWithError utility
- Include proper request timeouts for all network requests (configure in api.ts)
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Cache responses where appropriate to minimize network calls
- Ensure all API endpoints are properly authenticated
- Follow the established pattern of separating entity-specific APIs (like blogApi, projectApi)
- Always use typed responses with generics (Promise<T>)
- Use the apiService for switching between mock and real APIs
- Maintain consistent endpoint structure (/entity and /entity/:id)
- For new entity types, create both real and mock API implementations
