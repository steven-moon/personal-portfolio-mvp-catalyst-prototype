# Description: Guidelines for React components in the Personal Portfolio MVP
# Globs: src/components/**/*.tsx, src/pages/**/*.tsx

## Component Structure
- Follow a consistent folder structure for components
- Group related components in the same directory
- Keep component files small and focused
- Split large components into smaller, reusable ones
- Use a clear naming convention for components (PascalCase)

## Component Organization
- Organize component code in the following order:
  1. Imports
  2. Type definitions (interfaces/types)
  3. Component function
  4. Helper functions
  5. Styles (if not using Tailwind inline)
  6. Exports

## Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations and callbacks
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

## shadcn/ui Integration
- Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation
- Customize shadcn/ui components with Tailwind classes
- Follow the shadcn/ui component patterns and conventions
- Use Tailwind merge for extending shadcn/ui components

## Neumorphic Design Implementation
- Use consistent shadow values for the neumorphic effect
- Maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Use subtle, smooth transitions for hover and active states
- Follow the soft UI principles with rounded corners and subtle shadows
