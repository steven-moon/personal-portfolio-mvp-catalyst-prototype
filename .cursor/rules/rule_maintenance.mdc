# Description: Guidelines for maintaining and updating Cursor rules
# Globs: .cursor/rules/**/*.mdc

## Rule Maintenance Guidelines
- Keep Cursor rules up to date with project changes and evolution
- When adding new technologies or patterns to the project, update relevant rules
- When changing code style or architecture decisions, reflect those in the rules
- Review and update rules periodically, at least once per quarter

## Rule Organization
- Keep rules categorized by domain (e.g., general, components, typescript)
- Use descriptive filenames for rule files
- Group related rules together
- Use consistent formatting across all rule files

## Rule Updates
- When updating the project structure, update the rules to match
- When adding new dependencies, update relevant rules with best practices
- When learning new patterns that work well for the project, document them in rules
- When encountering common issues or anti-patterns, add guidance to avoid them

## Recent Rule Updates
- 2023-MM-DD: Initial creation of Cursor rules
- YYYY-MM-DD: Updated network-apis.mdc to include timeout and retry logic guidelines
- YYYY-MM-DD: Enhanced TypeScript rules with more specific type guidance

## Auto-Update Process
- When making significant changes to the codebase, prompt yourself to update relevant rules
- Run a quarterly review of all rules to ensure they are current
- When updating development standards or team practices, update the rules immediately
- Consider setting up a Git hook to remind about rule updates during major version changes

## Rule Content
- Keep rule descriptions clear and concise
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Organize rules in logical sections
- Include references to relevant configuration files using @file
- Add examples for complex rules when necessary
