# Description: Project architecture and structure guidelines for the Personal Portfolio MVP
# Globs: **/*

## Project Structure
- Follow the directory structure outlined in the README
- Keep related files together in appropriate directories
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between components

## Architecture Patterns
- Use React Router for navigation and routing
- Implement proper data fetching with React Query
- Use Context API for global state management when necessary
- Follow the container/presentation pattern for complex components
- Implement code splitting for performance optimization

## File Organization
- Group related components in the same directory
- Place shared utilities in the utils directory
- Use the lib directory for third-party integrations
- Keep hooks in the hooks directory
- Store mock data and content in the data directory

## Code Structure
- Keep files small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use consistent export patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use lazy loading for routes and large components

## Scalability Considerations
- Design components to be reusable
- Implement proper abstractions for potential future needs
- Consider performance implications of architectural decisions
- Document architectural decisions and patterns
- Follow established React patterns and best practices
