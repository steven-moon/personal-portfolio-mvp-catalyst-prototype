## 2023-05-22: Initial Project Setup

### What Changed
- Set up React + TypeScript project with Vite
- Installed and configured TailwindCSS
- Added shadcn/ui components
- Created initial project structure
- Set up basic routing

### Why
Established foundation for the personal portfolio website with modern tech stack focusing on performance and developer experience.

### How
Used Vite's React TypeScript template as a starting point, then added custom configurations for TailwindCSS and other dependencies.

### Notes/Challenges
Resolved some initial configuration issues with path aliases in TypeScript by updating tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts.

## 2023-05-23: Implemented Neumorphic Design System

### What Changed
- Created custom TailwindCSS utilities for neumorphic design
- Implemented base components:
  - NeumorphicCard
  - NeumorphicButton (with variants)
  - NeumorphicInput

### Why
Established a consistent design language for the entire application that provides a modern, tactile feel.

### How
Extended TailwindCSS configuration with custom shadows and colors specific to neumorphic design. Created base components that leverage these custom utilities.

### Notes/Challenges
Found that contrast was initially an issue with pure neumorphic design. Modified shadow intensities and added subtle borders to improve accessibility while maintaining the neumorphic aesthetic.
