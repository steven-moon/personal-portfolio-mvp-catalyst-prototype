## 2025-03-06: Contact Message Admin Interface Implementation

### What Changed
- Created a new "Messages" section in the admin dashboard
- Implemented `MessagesList.tsx` component with the following features:
  - Displays all contact form submissions in a chronological list
  - Visually indicates unread messages with a border highlight
  - Shows sender information, subject, and message preview
  - Implemented proper loading and empty states
- Developed `MessageDetail.tsx` component for viewing full message content:
  - Automatically marks messages as read when viewed
  - Displays complete sender information and timestamp
  - Includes a "Reply via Email" feature
  - Implemented responsive layout with clear typography
- Enhanced API integration:
  - Added authentication token handling for protected endpoints
  - Implemented proper error handling for API requests
  - Created mock implementations for development without backend
  - Added localStorage persistence for mock data
- Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety:
  - Created `ContactMessage` interface for message data structure
  - Ensured consistent type usage across components

### Why
The contact form was previously only collecting submissions without providing administrators a way to view or manage them. This enhancement creates a complete communication workflow where visitors can send messages and administrators can efficiently view and respond to them.

### How
- Extended the admin dashboard with a new "Messages" card using the dashboard's existing design system
- Used the neumorphic design system to maintain visual consistency
- Implemented token-based authentication for accessing protected API endpoints
- Created a detailed message view with responsive layout adjustments
- Fixed API integration issues by properly sending authentication tokens with requests

### Notes/Challenges
Encountered authentication issues when attempting to access protected backend endpoints. Fixed by implementing proper token handling in API requests. Also dealt with challenges in making the BaseRepository return proper data after updates, which was essential for properly marking messages as read.

## 2024-08-15: Enhanced Image Handling and UI Components

### What Changed
- Created a new dedicated `ImageCard` component for consistent project image rendering
- Significantly improved the `LocalImage` component with better error handling and fallbacks
- Enhanced image uploading in the `ProjectEditor` component with the following improvements:
  - Added timestamp to image URLs to ensure uniqueness
  - Improved image verification in localStorage before adding to projects
  - Added duplicate detection prevention with better URL normalization
  - Enhanced debugging output for troubleshooting image issues
- Fixed issues with image rendering in new project creation workflow

### Why
Users experienced issues with images not displaying properly after upload, particularly when uploading the same image multiple times. The existing implementation couldn't handle duplicate images correctly, and localStorage retrieval was unreliable.

### How
- Created a reusable `ImageCard` component with standardized rendering and controls
- Updated `LocalImage` component with multiple lookup strategies for images in localStorage
- Modified `handleImageUploaded` function to always add a timestamp to images, ensuring uniqueness
- Implemented comprehensive image verification before adding to projects
- Added robust error handling with descriptive user feedback

### Notes/Challenges
Encountered complex issues with image handling due to multiple storage mechanisms (direct localStorage keys, JSON objects, and timestamps in URLs). Solved by implementing a comprehensive verification system and ensuring images are stored under multiple keys for reliable retrieval.

## 2023-05-22: Initial Project Setup

### What Changed
- Set up React + TypeScript project with Vite
- Installed and configured TailwindCSS
- Added shadcn/ui components
- Created initial project structure
- Set up basic routing

### Why
Established foundation for the personal portfolio website with modern tech stack focusing on performance and developer experience.

### How
Used Vite's React TypeScript template as a starting point, then added custom configurations for TailwindCSS and other dependencies.

### Notes/Challenges
Resolved some initial configuration issues with path aliases in TypeScript by updating tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts.

## 2023-05-23: Implemented Neumorphic Design System

### What Changed
- Created custom TailwindCSS utilities for neumorphic design
- Implemented base components:
  - NeumorphicCard
  - NeumorphicButton (with variants)
  - NeumorphicInput

### Why
Established a consistent design language for the entire application that provides a modern, tactile feel.

### How
Extended TailwindCSS configuration with custom shadows and colors specific to neumorphic design. Created base components that leverage these custom utilities.

### Notes/Challenges
Found that contrast was initially an issue with pure neumorphic design. Modified shadow intensities and added subtle borders to improve accessibility while maintaining the neumorphic aesthetic.
